"Which digital tools should I be using?" is a question I’m often asked.

As solopreneurs, we're constantly juggling responsibilities, from client work to marketing our business. And with countless digital tools available, finding the right ones to support our solo venture can be overwhelming.

I've compiled a list of the tools I have used to scale my one-person business’s revenue to over $8M in 5 years.

Kajabi is the ultimate platform for course creators, coaches, and solopreneurs who want to share their knowledge with the world.

This all-in-one tool simplifies the entire process of creating, marketing and selling online courses. As an enterprise-level user, I can vouch for its efficiency and ease of use.

It bundles my website, landing pages, email provider, forms, CRM, and online courses together. You can’t beat the efficiency.

Solopreneurs need reliable and secure payment processors to handle transactions from different sources. Stripe provides the ultimate payment solution that makes it easy to accept payments (no matter how much revenue you have).

It’s an all-in-one platform that lets you manage and process customer payments worldwide. Easy integration with the most popular eCommerce platforms — and its developer-friendly tools — make it ideal for solopreneurs who want to fully customize their payment method.

It also makes the invoicing process effortless. You can add your client’s info, bill your services, and email it directly to them via the billing menu.

And the payouts? Every weekday — I’m not held hostage while someone loans my money out for interest (like other payment processors do).

Testimonial makes gathering and showcasing your client testimonials incredibly easy. This amplifies your credibility and builds trust with potential clients and customers. I’ve been using Testimonial to effortlessly collect and display reviews for The LinkedInOS, and the increased conversions have been outstanding.

Testimonial’s unique features make it the go-to choice for solopreneurs looking to bolster their social proof:

Best LinkedIn tool for rapid growth and monetization

It’s no secret that LinkedIn is my bread and butter. While I’ve grown an impressive audience on other platforms, no other channel has created nearly as much revenue for me.

That said, I’m a busy solopreneur. And Taplio automates much of the tedium required to scale on Linkedin — far beyond your usual social planning tool.

Taplio also has a built-in post review system. This lets you see exactly how your post will appear (crucial for making sure your hook shows above the “read more” cutoff).

Designed to optimize and amplify your Twitter presence, Hypefury has quickly become my go-to for all things Twitter. From scheduling tweets to maximizing engagement, Hypefury has helped me grow my audience, increase my reach, and build genuine connections on the platform.

While there are other Twitter tools, Hypefury is easily the most robust and intuitive. Even the least tech-savvy solopreneurs can use it to scale their Twitter presence.\

Here are the core features that make Hypefury stand out from the crowd:

Best privacy-compliant web analytics for solopreneurs

Fathom is a privacy-focused web analytics tool perfect for solopreneurs who prioritize both data insights and customer privacy. Google Analytics (the most popular analytics tool) is difficult to use and understand, but I’ve found Fathom Analytics to be incredibly intuitive.

It takes less than two minutes to set up and provides a full understanding of your website's performance without compromising visitor trust (or privacy laws).

A solopreneur’s website is their base of operations, so it's crucial to understand its performance while respecting your users’ privacy. Fathom is by far the best solution for meeting both of these goals.

Fathom offers a range of core features that make it an indispensable tool for solopreneurs:

Loom is the asynchronous video messaging platform that has transformed the way I communicate with clients, collaborators, and my audience. Designed to simplify communication, Loom lets you record and share videos of your screen, voice, and face in a few clicks.

It’s saved me a ton of money (and time) when building out my courses.

Loom’s features are incredibly useful for solopreneurs:

As a solopreneur, you face the unique challenge of handling multiple responsibilities alone. And with so many digital tools available, choosing the right one can be tricky.

Here's a quick recap of the tools we covered (and their primary uses):

Now that you know the tools, it's time to put them to work — choose the tools best suited to your solo business and get started.

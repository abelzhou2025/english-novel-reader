                        <div class="english-text">A Google DeepMind agent that can make complex plans in a virtual world. The AI lab debuted an updated version of its SIMA agent, called SIMA 2, that can navigate complex, 3D digital worlds, including those from different video games. Unlike earlier systems that only followed simple commands, SIMA 2 can understand broader goals, hold short conversations, and figure out multi-step plans on its own. In tests, it performed far better than its predecessor and came close to human players on many tasks, even in games it had never seen before. Notably, SIMA 2 can also teach itself new skills by setting its own challenges and learning from trial and error. The paper shows progress towards AI that can act, adapt, and learn in environments rather than just analyze text or images. The approach, which is based on reinforcement learning---a technique where an agent learns by trial and error to accomplish a goal---should help power more capable virtual assistants and, eventually, real-world robots.

                        <div class="chinese-text loading-translation" data-english="A Google DeepMind agent that can make complex plans in a virtual world. The AI lab debuted an updated version of its SIMA agent, called SIMA 2, that can navigate complex, 3D digital worlds, including those from different video games. Unlike earlier systems that only followed simple commands, SIMA 2 can understand broader goals, hold short conversations, and figure out multi-step plans on its own. In tests, it performed far better than its predecessor and came close to human players on many tasks, even in games it had never seen before. Notably, SIMA 2 can also teach itself new skills by setting its own challenges and learning from trial and error. The paper shows progress towards AI that can act, adapt, and learn in environments rather than just analyze text or images. The approach, which is based on reinforcement learning---a technique where an agent learns by trial and error to accomplish a goal---should help power more capable virtual assistants and, eventually, real-world robots.

A few weeks ago, the Future of Life Institute (FLI) released its latest AI Safety Index, a report that grades leading AI labs on how they are doing on a range of safety criteria. A clear gap has emerged between three of the leading AI labs and pretty much everyone else. OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic all received grades in the "C" range. Anthropic and OpenAI both scored a C+, with Anthropic narrowly beating OpenAI on its total safety score. Google DeepMind's solid C was an improvement from the C- it scored when FLI last graded the field on their safety efforts back in July. But the rest of the pack is doing a pretty poor job. X.ai and Meta and DeepSeek all received Ds, while Alibaba, which makes the popular open source AI model Qwen, got a D-. (DeepSeek's grade was actually a step up from the F it received in the summer.)</div>

Not only did all the labs pull up their raw scores by at least some degree, more AI companies agreed to submit data to FLI in order to be graded. Tegmark sees this as evidence that the AI Safety Index is starting to have its intended effect of creating "a race to the top" on AI safety. But Tegmark also allows that all three of the top-marked AI labs saw their scores for "current harms" from AI---such as the negative impacts their models can have on mental health---slip since they were assessed in the summer. And when it comes to potential "existential risks" to humanity, none of the labs gets a grade above D. Somehow that doesn't cheer me.</div>

            <p class="english-text">Since January, many of these companies have seen their stock prices surge after announcing splashy deals with major AI developers, even if the details are often fuzzy. But the amount of money pouring into the space and the speed of the run-up in valuations has also raised questions about how sustainable the rally is.

Jack Cogen, their former boss at Natsource, is also a billionaire thanks to an early investment.

            <p class="english-text">Jonathan Ross first began working on computer chip architecture as a side project in 2012, while developing advertising systems at Google. He'd landed the job despite not having a college degree --- or even a high school degree.</p>

            <p class="english-text">Ross was part of a team that came up with the tensor processing unit, or TPU --- a specialized type of chip that's specifically designed for machine learning, unlike the graphics-focused GPUs made by Nvidia and competitors, which were initially developed for gaming.</p>

            <p class="english-text">After incubating the technology internally, Ross and a few colleagues split off from Google and founded Groq in 2016. The next year, Groq secured a $10 million seed investment from venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya's fund, Social Capital. Groq became a unicorn in 2021, when it raised $300 million in a funding round led by Tiger Global Management and D1 Capital.</p>

Eight years later, the company went public in the largest software IPO ever with a valuation of more than $33 billion. Its blistering debut made its chief executive officer, Frank Slootman, a billionaire alongside the co-founders; options he was receiving as part of an earlier compensation package were worth $108 million every month. Snowflake's former chief financial officer, Michael Scarpelli, also became a billionaire.</p>

Snowflake is also producing its own AI tools to help customers interact with their data. The company's revenue has grown more than 13-fold since its public debut to $3.6 billion last fiscal year.

            <p class="english-text">Residents are grappling with increased electricity prices as nearby AI data centers come online.</p>
            
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph-block">

        <div class="paragraph-block">
            <p class="english-text">In Baltimore, Nike Carstarphen saw her electricity rate go up 20% in the span of a month, even though she was using 40% less electricity because she'd stopped turning on her air conditioner, CNN reported. Her utility company, Baltimore Gas and Electric (BGE), had prices increase by $32 per month on average in September, according to the outlet. The larger electricity cost is primarily due to new data centers in northern Virginia.</p>
            
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph-block">
            
            
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph-block">
            <p class="english-text">"We shouldn't be subsidizing [the AI companies]," Carstarphen told the outlet. "They have enough money."</p>

        <div class="paragraph-block">

        <div class="paragraph-block">
            <p class="english-text">The woman isn't alone. Amidst an AI boom, massive data centers are being constructed across the country, bringing jobs and revenue to communities, but also drawbacks. The impact is reverberating from northern Virginia, currently the largest data center market in the world, according to a report from the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission (JLARC). The region houses 13% of "all reported data center operational capacity globally."</p>

            <p class="english-text">The consequences are already being felt by residents in neighboring Maryland and Washington, D.C., with BGE consumers seeing the increased costs distributed over lower-usage months, CNN reported.</p>

        <div class="paragraph-block">
            
            
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph-block">
            <p class="english-text">The additional cost doesn't appear directly on electricity bills, and is instead hidden in electricity supply charges, according to the report. (Data centers are not the only factor in higher electricity prices. A recent study featured in The Electricity Journal found that a variety of factors, including natural disasters "contributed to sizable price increases in some states," as well as shifts in natural gas prices.)</p>

        <div class="paragraph-block">
            <p class="english-text">There are two reasons data centers are driving up residential electricity costs in the region: the great need for electricity and the new infrastructure that's required to deliver it, according to CNN.</p>

        <div class="paragraph-block">
            <p class="english-text">A 2024 report from the U.S. Department of Energy found that data centers used approximately 4.4% of total U.S. electricity in 2023, and are expected to consume about 6.7 to 12% of U.S. electricity by 2028.</p>

            <p class="english-text">The hike in electricity prices is "the tip of the iceberg," Marina Domingues, the vice president of U.S. New Energies at the Rystad Energy research firm, told CNN.

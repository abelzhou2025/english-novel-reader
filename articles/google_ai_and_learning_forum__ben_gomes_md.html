Imagine a student who's curious, but struggling with a concept or a complex idea. Because of the power of AI to transform content, the student can now get that content in a way in which they can relate to it, and this can make them feel capable of learning anything. They can stay in that zone of proximal development where they are challenged, but not overwhelmed. The models can even help with motivation.

The percentage of teens taking jobs has declined 50% in a generation. And the workforce participation rate of 16-24 year-olds has followed the same downward trend. A small part of the decline may be due to crowding out by older workers and immigrants. But most comes from a culture of monomaniacal focus on academics and enriching extracurricular activities in order to burnish applications for the next level of schooling. As college admissions whisperer Jeff Selingo wrote in the *Washington Post*, "upper-middle class families and above have made the determination that college admissions officers devalue paid work and that if you're not pursuing a hectic schedule of activities you'll be less appealing to colleges." This college-centric formula doesn't leave much room for mowing lawns, scooping ice cream, or bussing tables.</div>

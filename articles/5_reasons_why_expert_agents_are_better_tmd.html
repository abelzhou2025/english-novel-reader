3. Precision --- As a result of that deep domain knowledge and integration with actual data, expert agents can be much more precise than a generic tool. They make fewer errors and have far fewer hallucinations.
4. Governance --- More accurate autonomous agents are far easier to oversee. Because of the well-defined use cases, it's far easier to apply guardrails and ethics rules, and audits become simpler as well.
5. ROI --- When it comes to resources, a expert agent has the right data to solve problems faster, driving greater agility while consuming less energy and compute cycles.

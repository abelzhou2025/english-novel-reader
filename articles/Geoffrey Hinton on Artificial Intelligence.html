            <p class="english-text">So what symbolic AI basically believed, I'm simplifying it, but it believed, If I give you a sentence in English, what you need to do is turn it into a sentence in some special language, some special internal symbolic language that's unambiguous, and you can then operate on that expression in the symbolic language using rules to derive new expressions, and that's what logic is, and that's how reasoning is going to work.</p>

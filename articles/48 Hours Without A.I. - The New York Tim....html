For starters, they check the weather, and nowadays almost every weather prediction is made with A.I."</p>

            <p class="english-text">Many people associate the term with generative A.I., which burst onto the scene in 2022. It's the technology that churns out college English papers and concocts images of smiling customers for soft drink ads. But the A.I. umbrella also covers other types of programs capable of learning and evolving --- including machine learning, which has been widespread since the 2000s. A machine learning program updates itself or its predictions based on new data. When the Waze app finds a shortcut to your sister's house, you can thank machine learning.</p>

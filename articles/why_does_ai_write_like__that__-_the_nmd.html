A.I.-generated writing, once the distant echo of science-fiction daydreams, is now all around us --- neatly packaged, fleetingly appreciated and endlessly recycled. It's not just a flood --- it's a *groundswell*. Yet there's something unsettling about this voice. Every sentence sings, yes, but honestly? It sings a little flat. It doesn't open up the tapestry of human experience --- it reads like it was written by a shut-in with Wi-Fi and a thesaurus. Not sensory, not real, just ... there.

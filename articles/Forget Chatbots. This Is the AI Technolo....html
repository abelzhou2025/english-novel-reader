            <p class="english-text">AI once again dominated the year's biggest tech events, for better or worse. However, behind the hype for iterative updates from major players were some genuinely interesting innovations with real potential to make our devices smarter and our lives easier. Here are some of the under-the-radar features you may have missed amid all the noise about ChatGPT or Gemini.</p>

        <div class="paragraph-block">
            <p class="english-text">Some of the most fascinating AI innovations involve computational photography techniques that use software and AI to enhance images or assist in capturing them.</p>
            
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph-block">
            
            
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph-block">
            <p class="english-text">Smartphones have long taken multiple images in quick succession when you press the shutter button, and blended them together into a single image. This technique is now used for context-aware burst modes, which choose the best image from a group of photos based on things like how sharply faces are in focus or if someone's blinking.</p>
            
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph-block">

        <div class="paragraph-block">
            <p class="english-text">There are also more advanced features like predictive exposure, seen in high-end cameras like the Sony Alpha or Fujifilm X-series. This allows a camera to analyze a scene over time and make a split-second decision about what it expects the lighting to be like when you snap a photo.</p>

        <div class="paragraph-block">
            <p class="english-text">Some phones and cameras also now include an AI tripod mode, which will detect when the device is at its most stationary before shooting. The ProCamera app for iOS, for example, has an "anti-shake" setting that delays the shutter release until the device is steady.</p>

        <div class="paragraph-block">
            <p class="english-text">Voice-to-text has improved across the board, as anyone who's been playing around with the new Alexa+ rollout can attest. But what you may not know is how transcription has made huge leaps in less visible spaces where it may be even more useful.</p>

            <p class="english-text">Updates this year---like those to Picovoice, OpenAI's Whisper models, and other leading edge-AI speech platforms---focused on speed, accuracy, and moving transcription processing from the cloud to devices.

        <div class="paragraph-block">
            <p class="english-text">A big focus this year was on-device AI, especially on the PC side. Instead of needing to ping the internet or do processing remotely, these AI PCs are increasingly shipping with built-in Neural Processing Units (NPUs). No cloud overhead means that computations are faster, more private, less reliant on server infrastructure, and have less environmental impact.</p>

        <h2 class="section-heading">Energy-Efficient NPUs: AI That Doesn't Kill Your Battery</h2>
        <div class="paragraph-block">
            <p class="english-text">Speaking of efficiency, one of the most vital tests for AI sustainability is energy efficiency. We've all heard the horror stories of AI data centers with their massive thirst for electricity and alarming carbon implications. Producing more energy-efficient hardware and models will be key to whether AI can be reasonably and safely implemented on larger scales.</p>
            
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph-block">
            
            
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph-block">
            <p class="english-text">NPUs are a big step in this direction. Because they're purpose-built to handle AI workloads, they can deliver high neural-model throughput at significantly lower power cost than traditional CPUs or GPUs. Beyond the environmental implications, this also means everyday AI users can access some of the technology's most powerful and useful features without blowing through their battery in a fraction of the time it would normally take.</p>

        <div class="paragraph-block">
            <p class="english-text">Energy-efficient NPUs are especially important for ensuring that "always on" AI features don't mean "always draining." Ideally, the next generation of AI-powered phones and laptops will be able to handle things like transcription, background image cleanup, email drafting, and deep research without having a massive impact on battery life. They'll also help cut down on the annoying whir of laptop fans trying to compensate for the extra heat a dedicated GPU generates.</p>

            <p class="english-text">Some of the most interesting AI products and features we saw this year were quiet, under-the-hood enhancements that are genuinely useful for tasks we complete every day. Unlike chatbots, which have been lightning rods for terrible PR, artistic plagiarism, and apocalyptic climate scenarios, these features focus on what AI does best---supplementing and supporting human endeavors, rather than trying to supplant them. Ideally, the end point for these kind of niche features is AI that's woven into our lives in seamless, truly helpful ways, where it's as ordinary as spellcheck.</p>

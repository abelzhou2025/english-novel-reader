</div>
<div class="paragraph-block">

</div>
<div class="paragraph-block">
<p class="english-text">My name is Ben Gomes. I lead our learning and sustainability at work at Google. I've been at Google a long time -- 26 years -- and for much of that time I worked on Search, which was meant to be the ultimate answer agent. But today, I have more questions than answers. That's what makes today's conversation one of the most important of our time --- about how AI will affect learning. To get it right, we need to make sure we ask the right questions and take the time to get the right answers. I'll offer a brief view of how we view the landscape of learning across AI.</p>
<p class="chinese-text">我叫本·戈麦斯。我在 Google 领导我们的学习和可持续发展工作。我在 Google 工作了很长一段时间（26 年），其中大部分时间我都在从事搜索业务，它的目标是成为最终的答案代理。但今天，我的问题多于答案。这就是为什么今天的对话成为我们这个时代最重要的对话之一——关于人工智能将如何影响学习。为了做到正确，我们需要确保提出正确的问题并花时间获得正确的答案。我将简要介绍我们如何看待人工智能的学习前景。</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph-block">

</div>
<h2 class="section-heading">How learning and technology interact today</h2>
<div class="paragraph-block">
<p class="english-text">First of all, what do we mean by learning? I think learning is the key instinct that sets us apart as a species. As human beings, the fundamental thing we can do is learn from other people. And that allows people to transmit a capability from one person to another and expand the space of human capabilities.</p>
<p class="chinese-text">首先，我们要明白什么是学习？我认为学习是使我们作为一个物种与众不同的关键本能。作为人类，我们能做的最基本的事情就是向他人学习。这使得人们能够将一种能力从一个人传递给另一个人，并扩大人类能力的空间。</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph-block">

</div>
<div class="paragraph-block">
<p class="english-text">For decades as a society, we've been working on translating that instinct to learn into formal educational systems, and there's been a lot of progress. Today, over 90% of primary school-age children are actually enrolled in primary school, which is really amazing from even a few decades ago. But the progress that we're seeing is uneven. And it's fragile.</p>
<p class="chinese-text">几十年来，作为一个社会，我们一直致力于将这种学习本能转化为正规教育系统，并且已经取得了很多进展。如今，90%以上的小学适龄儿童实际上已经进入小学，这在几十年前确实是令人惊叹的。但我们看到的进展并不平衡。而且它很脆弱。</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph-block">

</div>
<div class="paragraph-block">
<p class="english-text">We are still seeing learning loss from the pandemic. We saw, for the first time on record, global drops in scores from PISA. These are not small problems. They're deep human problems. We're also seeing problems on the side of the teachers. There's projected to be a global shortage of 44 million teachers by 2030. Teachers are happy with the work they're doing but a lot of them have burnt out. So we have many challenges to address. And at the same time AI has entered the scene and given machines the ability to manipulate language.</p>
<p class="chinese-text">我们仍然看到疫情带来的学习损失。我们有史以来第一次看到全球 PISA 分数下降。这些都不是小问题。它们是人类深层次的问题。我们也看到教师方面存在问题。预计到 2030 年，全球将短缺 4400 万名教师。教师们对自己所做的工作很满意，但很多人已经精疲力尽。因此，我们有许多挑战需要解决。与此同时，人工智能已经进入场景，赋予机器操纵语言的能力。</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph-block">

</div>
<div class="paragraph-block">
<p class="english-text">What's special about language is that it's a fundamental tool that's used in learning. With AI there's a possibility of expanding this, the scope of what we can do in learning. But I want to be clear: the fundamental reason we learn is not because of technology. It's because of human beings. That human connection is at the core of learning. That's why we don't want to replace that central connection of learning. We want to enhance it. That is our North Star.</p>
<p class="chinese-text">语言的特别之处在于它是学习中使用的基本工具。有了人工智能，就有可能扩大我们学习的范围。但我想明确的是：我们学习的根本原因不是因为技术。这是因为人类。人际关系是学习的核心。这就是为什么我们不想取代学习的核心联系。我们想要增强它。那是我们的北极星。</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph-block">

</div>
<div class="paragraph-block">
<p class="english-text">So, what role does technology then play in the space of learning? Over the decades, the internet and technologies, like Search, actually improved access to information. They removed barriers. But with AI, you can actually change how people interact with information. AI has two great powers that are relevant in the space of learning. One of them is this deep kind of interaction that goes far beyond just getting information. The other is the ability to transform information from one format to another. And we can see the application of these two powers through the lens of the student and the lens of the teacher.</p>
<p class="chinese-text">那么，技术在学习空间中扮演什么角色呢？几十年来，互联网和搜索等技术实际上改善了信息的获取。他们消除了障碍。但借助人工智能，您实际上可以改变人们与信息交互的方式。人工智能在学习领域具有两大相关的强大力量。其中之一是这种深入的互动，远远超出了获取信息的范围。另一个是将信息从一种格式转换为另一种格式的能力。我们可以通过学生的镜头和老师的镜头来看到这两种力量的运用。</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph-block">

</div>
<h2 class="section-heading">How AI can help students learn</h2>
<div class="paragraph-block">
<p class="english-text">From the perspective of the student, AI can provide the ability to have a deeply personalized learning experience. Imagine a student who's curious, but struggling with a concept or a complex idea. Because of the power of AI to transform content, the student can now get that content in a way in which they can relate to it, and this can make them feel capable of learning anything. They can stay in that zone of proximal development where they are challenged, but not overwhelmed. The models can even help with motivation. They're incredibly good at finding ways to connect one idea to another. They can translate what's on a textbook page --- a dry idea --- into something that's meaningful to the student, and actually motivate them to learn the concept.</p>
<p class="chinese-text">从学生的角度来看，人工智能可以提供深度个性化的学习体验。想象一个学生很好奇，但对一个概念或复杂的想法感到困惑。由于人工智能转换内容的能力，学生现在可以以一种与他们相关的方式获取内容，这可以让他们觉得有能力学习任何东西。他们可以留在最近发展的区域，在那里他们会受到挑战，但不会被压倒。这些模型甚至可以帮助激发动力。他们非常擅长寻找将一个想法与另一个想法联系起来的方法。他们可以将教科书上的内容（一个枯燥的想法）翻译成对学生有意义的东西，并真正激励他们学习这个概念。</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph-block">

</div>
<div class="paragraph-block">
<p class="english-text">With AI, I can take content and turn it into other immersive formats like podcasts and videos and mind maps. And in doing so, break down long-standing barriers in education for people with learning disabilities and provide access that they have never had before. So, for the first time, we have a tool that can help make anything learnable by anyone.</p>
<p class="chinese-text">借助人工智能，我可以将内容转化为其他沉浸式格式，例如播客、视频和思维导图。这样做可以打破学习障碍人士长期存在的教育障碍，并为他们提供以前从未有过的机会。因此，我们第一次拥有了一个可以帮助任何人学习任何东西的工具。</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph-block">

</div>
<h2 class="section-heading">How AI can help educators focus on what matters most</h2>
<div class="paragraph-block">
<p class="english-text">For educators, AI can be a powerful teaching assistant. It can help overburdened educators who are burning out do a lot of the administrative work: to create lesson plans, to help with their instruction and to create activities for their students. This doesn't replace the work that they're doing --- the fundamental connection that they're building --- but it aims to free up their time and give them that time to spend with the student. The time to inspire. The time to motivate and create that joy. The time to foster curiosity. And the time to spark a lifelong love of learning.</p>
<p class="chinese-text">对于教育工作者来说，人工智能可以成为强大的教学助手。它可以帮助负担过重、精疲力竭的教育工作者完成大量的行政工作：制定课程计划、帮助他们进行教学并为学生创造活动。这并不会取代他们正在做的工作——他们正在建立的基本联系——但它的目的是释放他们的时间，让他们有时间与学生一起度过。激发灵感的时间。是时候激励和创造那种快乐了。培养好奇心的时间。是时候激发对学习的终生热爱。</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph-block">

</div>
<div class="paragraph-block">
<p class="english-text">While AI can help with the learning process, the inspiration still comes from the connection with a person. Almost everybody here has had some experience with a teacher that transformed them. For me, it was my mother, a chemistry teacher, who changed my life and instilled within me a real curiosity to learn and to understand.</p>
<p class="chinese-text">虽然人工智能可以帮助学习过程，但灵感仍然来自于与人的联系。这里几乎每个人都曾有过与一位改变了他们的老师的经历。对我来说，是我的母亲，一位化学老师，改变了我的生活，并向我灌输了真正的学习和理解的好奇心。</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph-block">

</div>
<div class="paragraph-block">
<p class="english-text">So the thing that inspires people is not a book. It's that connection to the person that inspires that love of learning. And when you get teachers who do that together with technology that really works to bring the student along, I think you have magic. And I think we have the potential for many more people around the world to experience a kind of magic that all of us, probably, at some point did. This is the promise.</p>
<p class="chinese-text">所以能够激励人们的东西不是书。正是这种与人的联系激发了人们对学习的热爱。当你的老师能够做到这一点，并结合真正能够带动学生进步的技术时，我认为你就有了魔力。我认为我们有潜力让世界各地更多的人体验到我们所有人可能在某个时候都经历过的一种魔力。这就是承诺。</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph-block">

</div>
<h2 class="section-heading">How we're tackling the challenges of AI and education</h2>
<div class="paragraph-block">
<p class="english-text">But to realize it, we also have to be clear-eyed about the challenges and the complexities. And they are significant. Technology and technologists have made big promises before. But we can learn from those previous cycles. We have learned that technology itself cannot solve these deep-rooted challenges. It has to be designed with clear pedagogical principles and in partnership with the teachers and students it's trying to serve. This is critical because AI itself is introducing new and urgent challenges.</p>
<p class="chinese-text">但要实现这一目标，我们还必须清醒地认识到挑战和复杂性。它们意义重大。技术和技术专家之前曾做出过重大承诺。但我们可以从之前的周期中吸取教训。我们了解到，技术本身无法解决这些根深蒂固的挑战。它的设计必须遵循明确的教学原则，并与它所服务的教师和学生合作。这一点至关重要，因为人工智能本身正在带来新的、紧迫的挑战。</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph-block">

</div>
<div class="paragraph-block">
<p class="english-text">The first challenge AI introduces is safety. It's a top priority for us to make sure that what we're exposing young learners to is safe for them. We do this through adversarial testing, but also in collaboration with people like you to monitor what's happening in real life so that we can address new challenges that emerge.</p>
<p class="chinese-text">人工智能带来的第一个挑战是安全。我们的首要任务是确保年轻学习者所接触的内容对他们来说是安全的。我们通过对抗性测试来做到这一点，但也与像您这样的人合作，监控现实生活中发生的事情，以便我们能够应对出现的新挑战。</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph-block">

</div>
<div class="paragraph-block">
<p class="english-text">Secondly, accuracy. These models have gotten vastly better the last few years in accuracy, but there's still a ways to go, and we continue to work to make these models ever more accurate so that they can gently guide a student from a misconception to the correct understanding and not to another hallucination. The question I hear the most in this context is: what about critical thinking? Will students offload their thinking to the machine? And while I think that's possible, I think we also have the ability to actually help the student in this way.</p>
<p class="chinese-text">其次，准确性。这些模型在过去几年中的准确性已经大大提高，但仍有很长的路要走，我们将继续努力使这些模型变得更加准确，以便它们能够温和地引导学生从误解到正确的理解，而不是另一个幻觉。在这种情况下我听到最多的问题是：批判性思维怎么样？学生会将他们的思维转移到机器上吗？虽然我认为这是可能的，但我认为我们也有能力以这种方式实际帮助学生。</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph-block">

</div>
<div class="paragraph-block">
<p class="english-text">We know that learning is about productive struggle. That does not mean maximal struggle. If you think about learning as it happens across the world, a lot of the struggle that happens is an unproductive struggle. It's because the content is at the wrong level. It's because it's in the modality that doesn't resonate for the student. It's about topics they don't relate to. AI can help eliminate that unproductive struggle so that the student and the teacher can focus on the most important part of the learning process, which is getting those critical thinking skills that really are at the heart of learning.</p>
<p class="chinese-text">我们知道学习就是富有成效的斗争。这并不意味着最大程度的斗争。如果你想想世界各地发生的学习，就会发现很多发生的斗争都是徒劳的。这是因为内容处于错误的级别。这是因为它的形式不能引起学生的共鸣。这是关于他们不相关的话题。人工智能可以帮助消除这种徒劳的挣扎，以便学生和老师可以专注于学习过程中最重要的部分，即获得真正处于学习核心的批判性思维技能。</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph-block">

</div>
<div class="paragraph-block">
<p class="english-text">And finally, and most importantly, we want universal participation. We have to ensure that these tools are available to everybody around the world. We have to ensure that they don't widen the existing gaps in education. A major challenge might be the 5% problem: the risk that only the most privileged, the richest, the best, most motivated students will benefit from AI and others will get left even further behind. We cannot allow this creation of a new digital divide. This means making models universally accessible around the world and in lots of languages that students are using. But it also means that teachers around the world must get trained on the best practices for learning and using AI themselves.</p>
<p class="chinese-text">最后，也是最重要的，我们希望普遍参与。我们必须确保世界各地的每个人都可以使用这些工具。我们必须确保它们不会扩大现有的教育差距。一个主要挑战可能是 5% 问题：只有最有特权、最富有、最优秀、最积极的学生才能从人工智能中受益，而其他人将被进一步抛在后面。我们不能允许这种新的数字鸿沟的产生。这意味着模型可以在世界各地以学生使用的多种语言普遍使用。但这也意味着世界各地的教师必须接受学习和使用人工智能最佳实践的培训。</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph-block">

</div>
<h2 class="section-heading">How we're approaching AI for learning</h2>
<div class="paragraph-block">
<p class="english-text">So, what is our approach? Our approach is guided by two principles. First, our work is grounded in learning science, because we understand that more technology, bigger models, is not going to be the solution in itself. Our AI models like Gemini are being developed specifically grounded in pedagogical principles. Principles like managing cognitive load, encouraging active learning, and stimulating curiosity. And this program, which we call LearnLM, is infused throughout our models.</p>
<p class="chinese-text">那么，我们的方法是什么？我们的方法遵循两个原则。首先，我们的工作以学习科学为基础，因为我们知道更多的技术、更大的模型本身并不能解决问题。我们像 Gemini 这样的人工智能模型是专门根据教学原则开发的。管理认知负荷、鼓励主动学习和激发好奇心等原则。这个程序，我们称之为 LearnLM，被注入到我们的模型中。</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph-block">

</div>
<div class="paragraph-block">
<p class="english-text">The second principle is that the promise of AI can only be achieved by active partnership. Partnership with people like you to enable us to develop these technologies in a way that is most useful and resonant for people around the world.</p>
<p class="chinese-text">第二个原则是人工智能的承诺只能通过积极的合作来实现。与像您这样的人合作，使我们能够以对世界各地的人们最有用和最能引起共鸣的方式开发这些技术。</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph-block">

</div>
<div class="paragraph-block">
<p class="english-text">And finally, we have to make sure that these AI tools are actually achieving the outcomes that we want them to achieve. We are committed to a research and evidence-based approach to learn, to iterate, and to be transparent about what's working and what's not.</p>
<p class="chinese-text">最后，我们必须确保这些人工智能工具确实实现了我们希望它们实现的结果。我们致力于采用研究和基于证据的方法来学习、迭代，并对哪些有效、哪些无效保持透明。</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph-block">

</div>
<div class="paragraph-block">
<p class="english-text">As we look ahead, we know that the technology will continue to evolve really rapidly. The biggest challenges will come not just in how we learn, but also in what we have to learn for a future that's being reshaped by AI. In the near term, we need to figure out how AI can be effectively adopted to enhance education. But in the longer term, we need to understand how AI can transform education to serve this changing world that's being shaped by AI. That's the goal of the conversation we'd like to have with all of you today.</p>
<p class="chinese-text">展望未来，我们知道该技术将继续快速发展。最大的挑战不仅在于我们如何学习，还在于我们必须为人工智能重塑的未来学习什么。短期内，我们需要弄清楚如何有效地采用人工智能来加强教育。但从长远来看，我们需要了解人工智能如何改变教育，以服务于人工智能正在塑造的不断变化的世界。这就是我们今天想与大家进行对话的目标。</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph-block">

</div>
<div class="paragraph-block">
<p class="english-text">Today is about dialogue. It's an invitation to share foresight. To challenge assumptions, including ours. And to begin to chart this unpredictable terrain together, as scientists, as educators, as technologists, as students. We want to learn from each other today. Together, we can shape and steer this technology to be aligned with the highest human goals. For learning and education, the greatest potential of AI is helping everyone reach theirs.</p>
<p class="chinese-text">今天是关于对话的。这是分享远见的邀请。挑战假设，包括我们的假设。作为科学家、教育工作者、技术专家和学生，开始共同描绘这个不可预测的领域。今天我们想互相学习。我们可以共同塑造和引导这项技术，使其与人类最高目标保持一致。对于学习和教育来说，人工智能的最大潜力是帮助每个人实现自己的目标。</p>

        <div class="paragraph-block">
            <p class="english-text">www.fastcompany.com Rashmita Redkar</p>
            
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph-block">
            
            
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph-block">
            <p class="english-text">Scroll your LinkedIn feed or scan your latest launch calendar. You will notice something odd: Virtually every value proposition uses a similar phrase: "AI-native," "Harnessing the power of AI," or "Revolutionizing [insert industry here] with generative AI." We are witnessing a convergence of messaging: distinct product strategies eroded by a rush to claim the same technical territory.</p>
            
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph-block">
            
            
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph-block">
            <p class="english-text">It feels like marketers got the same memo: Add AI to everything. But in the rush to slap an AI sticker on every product, I have to ask, have we confused the technology for the value proposition?</p>
            
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph-block">
            
            
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph-block">
            <p class="english-text">This homogeneity is a symptom of strategic anxiety. Boardrooms demand an "AI roadmap," creating a top-down pressure cooker. VCs disproportionately fund the .AI domain. And the fear of being labeled a legacy incumbent is palpable.</p>
            
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph-block">
            
            
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph-block">
            <p class="english-text">This creates a dangerous cycle. Product teams, under pressure to innovate, start "AI-washing" existing features or bolting on generative models to legacy stacks. The result is a solution looking for a problem. This is handed to marketing with the directive: Make this sound revolutionary.</p>
            
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph-block">

        </div>
        <div class="paragraph-block">
            <p class="english-text">We are flooding the market with technical specifications rather than solving business problems. We are selling the chrome-plated oven, while the customer wants a pizza.</p>
            
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph-block">
            
            
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph-block">
            <p class="english-text">AI is arguably the most significant shift of our lifetime. However, we are mistaking adoption for differentiation. Having a large language model (LLM) in your stack is no longer innovation; it is table stakes.</p>

        <h2 class="section-heading">THE ARCHITECTURE VALUE GAP</h2>
        <div class="paragraph-block">
            <p class="english-text">Fundamental marketing rules and mandates haven't changed. The medium has changed. Your customer has a problem to solve, and it is not a lack of artificial intelligence in their life.</p>
            
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph-block">
            
            
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph-block">
            <p class="english-text">Customers are not thinking "If only I could infuse synergistic LLMs into my workflow!" Instead, they're thinking: "Why is this report taking six hours to build?" "Why is our customer support so slow?" and "Why is this expensive? Is there a more efficient way?"</p>
            
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph-block">
            
            
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph-block">
            <p class="english-text">AI is a game-changing architecture to help answer those questions. But it is the architecture , not the value proposition. Marketing the architecture is like a restaurant bragging about its convection oven. I don't care about your oven. I care about the pizza. Is it delicious? Will it arrive on time?</p>
            
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph-block">
            
            
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph-block">
            <p class="english-text">We are witnessing a regression in value engineering. We are selling technical capabilities rather than business outcomes. In the enterprise specifically, buyers do not buy novelty; they buy risk mitigation and efficiency gains.</p>
            
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph-block">

        <h2 class="section-heading">STOP SELLING THE OVEN, START SELLING THE PIZZA</h2>
        <div class="paragraph-block">
            <p class="english-text">The era's winners won't be the companies with the most "AI-powered" bullet points. The winners will be marketers who can masterfully translate the opaque technical capabilities into clear, predictable business outcomes.</p>
            
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph-block">
            
            
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph-block">
            <p class="english-text">The gap is a lack of imagination in how we apply and position these capabilities. We're stuck in a loop of describing the ingredients instead of the meal.</p>
            
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph-block">
            
            
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph-block">
            <p class="english-text">Bad marketing: "Our website has an AI-powered chat assistant!" So what? Is it going to understand my query, or is it just another automated dead-end?</p>
            
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph-block">
            
            
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph-block">
            <p class="english-text">Good marketing: "Ask our assistant to find three-bedroom homes near the best schools, and it will also tell you about nearby parks and grocery stores." It saves me two hours of research? You have my attention.</p>
            
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph-block">
            <p class="english-text">You've mastered selling the pizza. You're ahead of 80% of the market. But competitors are catching on. Soon, selling benefits will be the baseline.</p>

            <p class="english-text">The true differentiator isn't just selling a pizza; it's selling the perfect pizza, custom-made with the toppings they didn't know to ask for. Effective marketers will become masters of context, understanding that the same AI feature represents a completely different value proposition to different customers.</p>

            <p class="english-text">Hyper-specific marketing for a proptech innovator: "Don't force homebuyers to filter by location. Use geospatial AI to let them ask, 'Find me a two-bedroom condo within a 15-minute walk of a dog park and a vegan cafe.'

            <p class="english-text">We operate at the intersection of technical feasibility and business strategy. It is not enough to know the customer; we must reverse-engineer their business models to understand where AI actually drives efficiency. We need to map technical capabilities directly to economic outcomes, understanding their legacy stacks and the specific bottlenecks in their workflows.</p>

        <div class="paragraph-block">
            <p class="english-text">This means your work isn't writing about "the power of AI." It is rigorous value discovery.

        <div class="paragraph-block">
            <p class="english-text">A new model drops every week. Businesses don't need another "AI-powered" tool; they need a strategic guide to help them make the right choice.

But those who stay grounded, who obsess over their customer's problems, and who master the art of selling not just a solution, but the right solution, are the ones who will build the next generation of indispensable brands. Not because they were "AI-native," but because they were, and always will be, customer-obsessed.</p>

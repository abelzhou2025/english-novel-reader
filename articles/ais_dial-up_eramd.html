                        <div class="english-text">*Historical data from the Industrial Revolution shows that even as aggregate textile employment grew, workers shifted between job types within the industry as some roles became redundant. And correspondingly, some jobs saw wages collapse while others saw increases. For example, domestic hand-loom weavers were displaced by power looms and saw their wages collapse, while self-acting mule spinners (a newly created role) and factory workers saw stable employment and steady compensation growth. Additionally, Britain’s deflationary period (1815-1850) saw food prices fall by half, meaning real purchasing power often rose even when nominal wages declined. Despite all this, the psychological reality was harsh. Even with falling prices, watching your paycheck shrink while neighbors lost jobs and debts grew harder to pay (lower wages but fixed obligations) created real instability regardless of aggregate statistics improvements.

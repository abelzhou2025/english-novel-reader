Mental health is often an area where there can be a disconnect between a patient's need and their access and availability of healthcare. There was a recent study that looked at using chatbots for supplementing---not replacing---care delivered by licensed mental healthcare professionals. It was a way to really interact with these patients, to gather their symptoms, to provide them with information and counseling without extending or overtaxing the human workforce. And the study found that they would've had to have hired four more mental health professionals to do what the chatbot did in a given month.</div>

I think that we're going to see an explosion in humanoid robotics.

Imagine a robot that could move patients around or clean operating rooms and patient beds between procedures or between hospital stays. Doing things in situations where a patient might be in isolation for an infectious disease or because of a weakened immune system. Doing physical therapy or helping patients at home who have mobility issues. I think the sky's the limit.</div>

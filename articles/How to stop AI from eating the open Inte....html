            <p class="english-text">SAN FRANCISCO--- In a startup hub near Chinatown, a few dozen programmers grabbed light beers and flipped open their laptops for a series of demonstrations on how to get around data scraping blockers.</p>
            
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph-block">
            
            
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph-block">
            <p class="english-text">Data scraping is the practice of using bots to extract information from websites --- a practice as old as the Web, used by everyone from serious researchers and archivists to content-stealing pirates. As that information has become more valuable over the decades, an arms race has sprung up around data-scraping, with many sites building walls to limit access and others aggressively trolling for ways in.</p>
            
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph-block">
            
            
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph-block">
            <p class="english-text">The programmers in the room had their own agenda, trying to find ways to keep public data accessible in the spirit of the original Web.</p>
            
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph-block">
            
            
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph-block">
            <p class="english-text">They were also there to figure out a pretty important question: What exactly are the rules around data scraping?</p>

        <div class="paragraph-block">
            
            
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph-block">
            <p class="english-text">It turns out that there aren't many --- in part because government regulators haven't really focused on this increasingly important issue. Internet data is now becoming a crucial resource in the AI boom, and there are ++ongoing clashes++ between major tech platforms that are trying to both hoard and capitalize on that data.</p>
            
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph-block">
            
            
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph-block">
            <p class="english-text">Caught in the crossfire are advocates for an open internet, and small-time content creators who want to get compensation for their work. It's a thorny dilemma: The internet was built on a communal ethos of free-flowing information, but that has also allowed AI companies to hoover up content for free, and make immense profits from it.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="paragraph-block">
            <p class="english-text">Legally speaking, they're largely doing it in a void. Federal law only loosely touches on data scraping, and courts have been slow to develop a body of law around the field. Instead, the industry mostly follows a set of customs and voluntary standards.</p>

        <div class="paragraph-block">
            <p class="english-text">In the absence of real engagement from lawmakers or other regulators, this meeting in San Francisco is a window into how the 30-year-old self-policing experiment called the World Wide Web has become a fractured, profit-driven domain. Large language models are making this an increasingly high-stakes argument --- though they're just the latest twist in a larger story about how internet data has transformed from the lifeblood of a free-flowing informational ecosystem into a monetization opportunity.</p>

        <div class="paragraph-block">
            <p class="english-text">The meetup was partly a tech demo, and partly a discussion on how to update those standards and influence the process. "If we're not setting our own best practices, someone else will be doing it for us," said Jo Levy, chair of the Alliance for Responsible Data Collection, which advocates for preserving open access to internet data.</p>

        <div class="paragraph-block">
            <p class="english-text">One issue her group faces:When it comes to standards setting, the most powerful players are major companies with deeply conflicting incentives. They benefit from walling off their own data while being able to scrape everyone else's.</p>

        <div class="paragraph-block">
            <p class="english-text">"If we're talking about whether people should be using voluntary standards to help them monetize their business on the internet, that's to me a different issue than whether people should follow voluntary standards because we want to maintain the accessibility and openness [...] of the internet," Levy told DFD.</p>
            
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph-block">
            
            
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph-block">
            <p class="english-text">One of the oldest informal tools to prevent web scraping is a protocol known as robots.txt. Website owners who don't want their data scraped and used by third parties can use the protocol to instruct bots not to siphon information from certain pages. But those instructions aren't compulsory --- developed as part of the earlier, communitarian culture of the web. Today, there's a greater incentive for AI companies to disregard them in the rush to build powerful models.</p>
            
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph-block">
            
            
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph-block">
            <p class="english-text">While robots.txt usually doesn't have the force of law, companies have sued when it's deliberately ignored, and such suits have become more frequent in the AI era. These lawsuits might once have been a powerful deterrent, but cash-rich AI companies can afford the litigation, said Jason Grad, CEO of Massive, a data collection tool company that co-hosted Monday's event. "[T]hey will have to defend their position... but they have the money to do that," he told DFD.</p>
            
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph-block">
            
            
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph-block">
            <p class="english-text">Levy also contends that robots.txt wasn't originally intended to be a guard dog for valuable information --- when it was devised in the 1990s, the focus was mostly on ensuring that bots didn't interfere with the functionality of a website, rather than safeguarding monetizable data.</p>
            
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph-block">
            
            
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph-block">
            <p class="english-text">International ++tech standards boards++ are now trying to come up with new ways to govern data scraping for AI. The Internet Engineering Task Force, for example, has set up working groups to come up with ways for websites to dictate how their data is collected for AI training.</p>
            
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph-block">
            
            
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph-block">
            <p class="english-text">Grad is wary of such developments: He says Big Tech has too much sway over standards boards. Working groups and committees are often chaired by representatives of companies like Google and Meta. "Some of these monopolies are really putting as many of their own people on these bodies as possible," he told DFD. "Why should we let the monopolies scrape and determine rules against scraping?"</p>

        <div class="paragraph-block">
            
            
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph-block">
            <p class="english-text">Big Tech companies in particular have considerable incentives to shape web crawling standards to make sure they're well positioned to access as much data as possible without giving up their own.</p>

        <div class="paragraph-block">
            <p class="english-text">Levy has been trying to convince more people who want to uphold the foundational openness of the internet --- but who might not have the resources or the cachet of a big company --- to get involved in the important drudgery of standards setting. During the San Francisco event, she encouraged attendees to sign up for the email lists where the boards often discuss the development of new protocols.</p>

            <p class="english-text">"A lot of what we're trying to do with ARDC is to make sure that interested parties are aware of these discussions and can participate," Levy told DFD.

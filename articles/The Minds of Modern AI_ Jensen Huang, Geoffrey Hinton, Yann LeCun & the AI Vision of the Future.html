<p class="english-text">thank you yes uh with pleasure. I would um go to two moments. One when I was a grad student and I was looking for something interesting to research on and I read some of Jeff Hinton's early papers and I thought wow this is so exciting. Maybe there are a few simple principles like the laws of physics that could help us understand human intelligence and help us build intelligent machines. And the second moment I want to talk about is two and a half years ago after chat GPT came out and I realized uhoh what are we doing?</p>
<p class="chinese-text">谢谢，是的，很高兴。我想讲两个时刻。有一次，当我还是一名研究生时，我正在寻找一些有趣的研究对象，我读了杰夫·辛顿 (Jeff Hinton) 的一些早期论文，我想哇，这太令人兴奋了。也许有一些简单的原理，比如物理定律，可以帮助我们理解人类智能并帮助我们构建智能机器。我想谈的第二个时刻是两年半前，聊天 GPT 出来后，我意识到呃我们在做什么？</p>

<p class="chinese-text">[翻译占位 - 翻译占位符]</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph-block">
<p class="english-text">00:02:38
Uh what will happen if we build machines that understand language uh have goals and we don't control those goals? What happens if they are smarter than us? Uh what happens if people abuse that power? So that's why I decided to completely shift my research agenda and my career to try to do whatever I could about it. &gt;&gt; That's that that's two kind of very you know diverging things very interesting build what tell us about your moment of like kind of building the infrastructure</p>
<p class="chinese-text">00:02:38
呃，如果我们建造能够理解语言的机器，呃，有目标但我们不控制这些目标，会发生什么？如果他们比我们聪明会发生什么？呃，如果人们滥用这种权力会发生什么？所以这就是为什么我决定彻底改变我的研究议程和我的职业生涯，并尽我所能。&gt;&gt; 那是两种非常你知道的不同的事情，非常有趣的构建，告诉我们你的类似构建基础设施的时刻</p>

<p class="chinese-text">[翻译占位 - 翻译占位符]</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph-block">
<p class="english-text">00:03:07
that's that's fueling what we have. &gt;&gt; I'll give you two moments as well. So the first was you know in in the late 90s I was at Stanford trying to figure out how to overcome what was at the time called the memory wall. fact that accessing data from memory is far more costly in energy and time than doing arithmetic on it. And it sort of you know struck me to organize computations into these kernels connected by streams. So you could do a lot of arithmetic without having to do very much memory</p>
<p class="chinese-text">00:03:07
这就是我们所拥有的燃料。&gt;&gt; 我也给你两个时间。第一个是你知道的，在 90 年代末，我在斯坦福大学试图弄清楚如何克服当时被称为记忆墙的东西。事实上，从内存中访问数据比对其进行算术要耗费更多的精力和时间。你知道，让我震惊的是，将计算组织到这些通过流连接的内核中。所以你可以做很多算术而不需要太多的内存</p>

<p class="chinese-text">[翻译占位 - 翻译占位符]</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph-block">
<p class="english-text">00:03:31
access. That basically led the way to what became called stream processing and ultimately GPU computing. Um and we we originally built that thinking we could apply GPUs not just for graphics but to general scientific computations. So the second moment was I was having breakfast with my colleague Andrew Ing at Stanford and at the time he was working at Google finding cats on the internet you using 16,000 CPUs in this technology called neural networks &gt;&gt; which fay had something to do with those</p>
<p class="chinese-text">00:03:31
访问。这基本上导致了所谓的流处理和最终的 GPU 计算。嗯，我们最初的想法是，我们不仅可以将 GPU 应用于图形，还可以应用于一般的科学计算。第二个时刻是我和斯坦福大学的同事 Andrew Ing 一起吃早餐，当时他在 Google 工作，在互联网上寻找猫，你在这种称为神经网络的技术中使用 16,000 个 CPU &gt;&gt; 这与那些有关</p>

<p class="english-text">and uh um he uh he he basically convinced me this is a great technology so I with Brian Kenzo repeated the experiment on 48 GPUs in Nvidia and when I saw the results of that I was absolutely convinced that this is what Nvidia should be doing. we should be building our GPUs to do deep learning because this has, you know, huge applications in all sorts of fields beyond finding cats. And that was kind of an aha moment to really start working very hard on specializing the GPUs for deep learning and and to make them more</p>
<p class="chinese-text">嗯嗯嗯嗯他基本上让我相信这是一项伟大的技术，所以我和 Brian Kenzo 在 Nvidia 的 48 个 GPU 上重复了实验，当我看到结果时，我绝对相信这就是 Nvidia 应该做的事情。我们应该构建 GPU 来进行深度学习，因为你知道，除了寻找猫之外，它在各个领域都有巨大的应用。那是一个顿悟的时刻，我真正开始努力将 GPU 专门用于深度学习，并让它们变得更加强大</p>

effective. &gt;&gt; And when was that what year? &gt;&gt; Um, the breakfast was in 2010 and I think we repeated the experiment in 2011. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Jeff, tell us tell us about your work. One very important moment was when I in about 1984 I tried using back propagation to learn the next word in a sequence of words. So it was a tiny language model and discovered it would learn interesting features for the meanings of words. So just giving it a string of symbols it just by trying to</p>
<p class="chinese-text">00:04:27
有效。&gt;&gt;那是哪一年的时间？&gt;&gt; 嗯，早餐是在 2010 年，我想我们在 2011 年重复了这个实验。 &gt;&gt; 好的。&gt;&gt; 是的。&gt;&gt; Jeff，请告诉我们您的工作。一个非常重要的时刻是，大约在 1984 年，我尝试使用反向传播来学习单词序列中的下一个单词。所以它是一个微小的语言模型，并发现它可以学习单词含义的有趣特征。所以只要给它一串符号就可以了</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph-block">

<p class="chinese-text">[翻译占位 - 翻译占位符]</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph-block">
<p class="english-text">00:04:58
predict the next word in a string of symbols it could learn how to convert words into sets of features that captured the meaning of the word and have interactions between those features predict the features of the next word. &gt;&gt; So that was actually a tiny language model from 1980 late 1984 um that I think of as as a precursor for these big language models. The basic principles were the same. It was just tiny. We had 100 training examples. It took 40 years to get us here though. &gt;&gt; And it took 40 years to get here. And</p>
<p class="chinese-text">00:04:58
预测一串符号中的下一个单词，它可以学习如何将单词转换为捕获单词含义的特征集，并通过这些特征之间的交互来预测下一个单词的特征。&gt;&gt; 这实际上是 1980 年末到 1984 年的一个小型语言模型，我认为它是这些大型语言模型的先驱。基本原则是相同的。它只是很小。我们有 100 个训练示例。然而，我们花了 40 年才到达这里。&gt;&gt; 我们花了 40 年才到达这里。和</p>

<p class="chinese-text">[翻译占位 - 翻译占位符]</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph-block">
<p class="english-text">00:05:26
the reason it took 40 years was we didn't have the compute and we didn't have the data and we didn't know that at the time. We couldn't understand why we weren't just solving everything with back propagation. &gt;&gt; Which takes us cleanly to to Jensen. We didn't have the compute for 40 years and here now you are building it. Tell tell us about your moments that of real kind of clarity. Well, for my career, um, I was the, uh, first generation of chip designers that was able to use higher level</p>
<p class="chinese-text">00:05:26
花了 40 年的时间是因为我们没有计算能力，没有数据，而且我们当时并不知道这一点。我们无法理解为什么我们不只是通过反向传播来解决所有问题。&gt;&gt; 这就把我们带到了詹森。我们已经有 40 年没有计算能力了，而现在你正在构建它。请告诉我们您真正清晰的时刻。嗯，就我的职业生涯而言，嗯，我是，呃，第一代能够使用更高级别的芯片设计师</p>

representations and design tools to design chips. and and uh that that discovery um uh was helpful when I learned about a new way of developing software uh around the 2010 time frame simultaneously from three different labs uh what was going on in uh uh University of Toronto researchers uh reached out reached out to us at the same time that uh researchers at the NYU reached out to um as well as uh in Stanford reached out to us at the same time and I I I saw the early indications of what turned out to</p>

have been deep learning around the same time uh using uh a framework uh and a structured design to uh create software and that software turned out to have been incredibly effective. Uh and that second that second observation uh is seen again using frameworks rep higher level representations structured types of uh structures like the deep learning networks. I uh was able to develop software uh w was very similar to designing chips for me and the patterns were very similar and I realized at that time maybe we could</p>

develop software uh and capabilities that that scale very nicely as we've scaled uh chip design over the years and so that was that was a quite a quite a moment for me &gt;&gt; and when do you think was the moment when the chips really started to help scale up today's sort of the the LLMs that we have today because you you said 2010 that's still a 15 year. &gt;&gt; Yeah. The the thing about about Nvidia's architecture is is once you're able to get something to run well on a GPU</p>
<p class="chinese-text">00:07:24
开发软件呃和能力，这些能力可以很好地扩展，因为我们多年来已经扩展了芯片设计，所以那对我来说是一个相当重要的时刻&gt;&gt;你认为什么时候芯片真正开始帮助扩展我们今天拥有的法学硕士，因为你说2010年仍然是15年。&gt;&gt; 是的。关于 Nvidia 架构的问题是，一旦你能够让某些东西在 GPU 上运行良好</p>

<p class="chinese-text">[翻译占位 - 翻译占位符]</p>

<div class="paragraph-block">
<p class="english-text">00:07:55
because it became parallel, you could get it to run well on multiple GPUs. that same sensibility of scaling uh the algorithm to run on many processors on one GPU. This is the same logic and the same reasoning that you could do it on multiple GPUs and then now multiple systems and in fact you know multiple data centers and so that once we realized we could do that effectively then then the rest of it is about about uh imagining how far you could extrapolate this capability. you know, how much data do we have? How large can</p>
<p class="chinese-text">00:07:55
因为它变得并行，所以你可以让它在多个 GPU 上良好地运行。缩放算法以在一个 GPU 上的多个处理器上运行具有同样的敏感性。这是相同的逻辑和相同的推理，您可以在多个 GPU 上执行此操作，然后现在在多个系统上执行此操作，实际上您知道多个数据中心，因此一旦我们意识到我们可以有效地做到这一点，那么剩下的就是关于呃想象一下您可以将这种能力推断到什么程度。你知道我们有多少数据吗？多大可以</p>

the networks be? How much dimensionality can it capture? What kind of problems can it solve? Uh the all of all of that is is really engineering at that point. You know, the the observation that that uh the deep learn deep learning models are so effective uh is is really quite the the the spark. The rest of it is really engineering extrapolation. Fei, tell us about your your moment. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I also have two moments to share. So around 2006 and 2007, I was transitioning from a graduate student to an a young assistant</p>

网络是什么？它可以捕获多少维度？它能解决什么样的问题？呃，所有这一切在那时都是真正的工程。你知道，深度学习模型如此有效的观察确实非常令人兴奋。其余部分实际上是工程外推。菲，请告诉我们你的时刻。&gt;&gt; 是的，我还有两个时刻要分享。所以在2006年和2007年左右，我从一个研究生过渡到一个年轻的助理</p>

So we um decided to do something crazy at that time to create a internet scale data set uh over the course of three</p>

So it's better to let itself be um like train itself or self-organized and that's the way you know intelligence in in in life uh builds itself. It's uh it's selforganized.

So then then there would be financial uh consequences uh if the expectations are not met but in the long run I completely agree. Um &gt;&gt; but currently what about the rest of you? Do you think that the valuations are justified in terms of what you know</p>
<p class="chinese-text">00:24:04
它们是否正在得到缓解，并且现在在如此多的基准测试中趋势非常明显，因为我们过去在改进技术方面取得了巨大的成功，但这并不意味着将来也会如此。因此，如果未达到预期，就会产生财务呃后果，但从长远来看，我完全同意。嗯&gt;&gt;但是目前你们其他人呢？据您所知，您认为估值合理吗？</p>

about the technology the applications? &gt;&gt; So I think there are three trends that sort of explain what's going on. The first is the models are getting more efficient. If you look just at attention for example, going from straight attention to GQA to MLA, you get the same or better results with far less computation. And so that then drives demand in ways where things that may have been too expensive before become inexpensive of now. You can do more with AI. At the same time, the models are</p>
<p class="chinese-text">00:24:35
关于技术的应用？&gt;&gt; 所以我认为三种趋势可以解释正在发生的事情。首先是模型变得更加高效。例如，如果你只关注注意力，从直接注意力到 GQA 到 MLA，你会用更少的计算得到相同或更好的结果。因此，这会以某种方式推动需求，使以前可能过于昂贵的东西现在变得便宜。您可以利用人工智能做更多事情。同时，模型是</p>

getting better and you know, maybe they'll continue to get better with transformers or maybe a new architecture will come along, but we will we won't go backwards. We're going to continue to have better models that also &gt;&gt; they still need GPUs even if &gt;&gt; absolutely transformer based &gt;&gt; um in fact it makes it makes them much more valuable compared to more specialized things because they're more flexible and they can evolve with the models better but then the final thing</p>
<p class="chinese-text">00:25:01
变得更好，你知道，也许他们会通过变压器继续变得更好，或者可能会出现新的架构，但我们不会倒退。我们将继续拥有更好的模型，它们仍然需要 GPU，即使 &gt;&gt; 绝对基于 Transformer &gt;&gt; 嗯，事实上，与更专业的东西相比，这使得它们更有价值，因为它们更灵活，并且可以更好地随模型一起发展，但最后的事情</p>

So as that expands, you know, the, you know, number of uses of this are going to go up. So I don't think there's any bubble here. I think we're, like Jensen said, we're riding a multiple</p>

Even if we look at uh modern physics and AI is less than 70 years old if we go back to Alan Turing you that's about 75 years so there is a lot more new frontiers that is to come uh you know Jensen and Yoshua talk about LLMs and agents those are more languagebased but even if you do uh self uh introspection</p>

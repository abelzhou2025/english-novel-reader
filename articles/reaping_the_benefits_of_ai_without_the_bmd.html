As the story goes, King Canute ordered his throne to be placed on the shore of a sea and, in front of his subjects, ordered the tide to stop. To no one's great shock, the tide refused to cooperate and came in anyway.

Living in the age of AI presents a strange and disorienting conundrum.

Sometimes the rhetoric goes beyond just getting "left behind" to outright getting fired if you don't use AI. That is no small amount of pressure and stress, and under the circumstances, denial becomes understandable since it is essentially a way to avoid pain.</div>

Just like with their employees, when leaders experience fear, it can result in silence, hesitation, or resistance to change. Both groups experience fear regarding artificial intelligence. Many leaders worry about what AI means for their people, their roles, and their future. But the real risk is not the technology as much as the fear that keeps leaders from understanding it and how to use it more efficiently. When leaders hesitate to engage with AI, they miss opportunities to determine how it will be used and teach their employees to do the same. Fear of AI often comes from uncertainty and a lack of confidence. People imagine worst-case scenarios instead of exploring what is possible. I have spoken with many leaders who admitted they waited too long to learn about AI and by the time they caught up, their competitors were already using AI to improve efficiency, gain insights from data, and create new value for customers.</div>

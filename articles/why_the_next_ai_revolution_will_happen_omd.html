Sanjit formerly founded Meraki, and has a legendary reputation amongst Sequoia-backed founders, so I'm excited to welcome him today for a conversation about physical AI. Samsara is a $20-billion market cap public company with sensors deployed in streaming data from millions of vehicles, capturing 90 billion miles annually. Sanjit shares his insights about the constraints of physical AI, from running inference on two- to ten-watt edge devices, to why the messy diversity of real world data is both the biggest challenge and opportunity for embodied AI. If you're building in robotics or physical AI, this conversation offers a rare perspective from somebody who's actually scaled it. Enjoy the show.*</div>

So there's risk detection, like, you know, please put down your mobile phone. But then if it's a habit of yours, we actually want to coach you to help break the habit, right? And if you kind of look at the impact we're able to have with customers, we often reduce risk, like, by 75 percent. So, you know, three quarters of the risk comes out of the system. Maybe half of that can come from the automated, like, in-the-moment, in-cab alert, and then the other half comes from coaching. And then that same coaching can be applied to, like, fuel efficiency. You can actually train drivers to operate heavy equipment in really smart ways. And you can gamify it, right? So that's the kind of, like, cool opportunity that AI has is to process just enormous amounts of data, more data than any human could do. You look at patterns across thousands or millions of vehicles and then turn it into actionable insight. That's coaching. So you can apply it to safety, you can apply it to efficiency.

I've become a big fan of, like, ChatGPT Pulse, for example. Like, it's just cool that it tells you about---for me, events that are happening in the Bay Area. I've got three kids and stuff. It kind of knows its interests, right? So the whole idea that AI could know you better than you to some extent is really profound. So I love that on the personal side.

We don't really, like, split it out, because there's value in the data, but if no one looks at the data, it doesn't have impact. So one of the things we've heard from customers is this concern about data overload. If you have sensor streams from every vehicle and every frontline worker and every asset, what do you do with it all, right? And so AI is pretty awesome in terms of really helping just distill that down to something actionable. So that's why I don't think you can split the two apart anymore.</div>

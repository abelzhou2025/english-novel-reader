That's exactly what we need to get economic growth going again: instead of just hiring more researchers (a harder and harder proposition), we make each existing researcher much more productive. That ideally translates into cheaper drug discovery and repurposing that can eventually bend health care costs; new battery and solar materials that make clean energy genuinely cheap; better forecasts and climate models that reduce disaster losses and make it easier to build in more places without getting wiped out by extreme weather.">正在翻译...</div>

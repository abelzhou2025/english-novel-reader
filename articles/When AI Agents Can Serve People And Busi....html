            <p class="english-text">In a recent panel discussion at Stanford, I heard a number of people close to the industry talk about the outcomes that are likely with quickly evolving AI. Most of this was focused on India in particular, but the ramifications have greater relevance across the globe, as we see that the human may be less and less "in the loop," as it were.</p>

            <p class="english-text">Comparing AI to the advent of electricity, panelist Abhishek Mehta discussed how such a sea change might affect enterprise in a big way. He also pointed out that some of this will be welcome, because AI will take over the low-hanging fruit, much of which, as he noted, is tedious and boring.</p>

            <p class="english-text">"One of the universal truths is that humans don't like doing things that are boring and repetitive, and humans are actually not good at doing things that are boring and repetitive," he said. "A lot of the work in the service industry is boring and repetitive. So with that logic, if you can automate things that that need repetition or are boring, naturally, it'd be a fair assumption to say that an agentic-powered world would probably replace (humans) at most of it, because it's going to be better at it."</p>

            <p class="english-text">"I think the reason that we're seeing such a big lean into services with AI is really this early-stage discovery of use cases," said panelist Maithra Ragu. "So many of these first AI companies, that are seeing a lot of growth, have realized that ... 'the AI out of the box, that's great, but we really need to understand the problems that we're solving for people,' and so they're going in deep however they can, using forward deployed engineering and all of that to really map out that end to end workflow, and then develop it out end to end."</p>

            <p class="english-text">"No one wakes up in the morning excited about entering data into systems," he said. "You don't get up in the morning and say, ' I love data entry.' I think we're seeing a fundamental shift where any system that is reliant on humans to enter data to become more efficient for business process, this has to exist because the data isn't ready in the enterprise to be used for high-intelligence use cases."</p>

            <p class="english-text">"I think, if you look at the large model companies, foundation model companies, I think if you look under the hood, you can find a lot of where that data work is happening," Clark added. "We talked about this idea that humans don't like inputting information, and that's absolutely true. In fact, I think at least half of the job titles for these workers are basically fancy data entry jobs."</p>

            <p class="english-text">"They're basically jobs that exist because one computer system needs information from another computer system, and since they couldn't talk to each other directly, we put humans in to be the capacitors between computer systems," Clark said. "It's kind of absurd, obviously, the notion that a human being, after they've entered the information, the slack and turns the CRM and like enters it again. It's obviously absurd, right? We were never born to teach computers numbers like that's just weird. So that question of, how is that going to happen, I think, is an area of a lot of active work."</p>

HR's expertise in recruitment and training will be crucial in this effort---only half of employees in SMEs believe their company has done a good job instilling technological know-how---and AI itself can play a powerful role in making a success of it. Forward-thinking organizations weave AI into workforce management, from how workers move internally to how they train and learn, Vyas says. "There's personalized learning journeys, there's internal mobility recommendations, there's workforce planning tied to all of these business scenarios."</div>

The traditional triangular org chart has been a mainstay since Brigadier General Daniel McCallum unveiled the first example in 1855. But many commentators believe that new architectures will coalesce to reflect how people work best with AI. Microsoft's Work Trend Index Annual Report 2025 argues that the org chart will be replaced with a "Work Chart," which it describes as "a dynamic, outcome-driven model where teams form around goals, not functions, powered by \[AI\] agents that expand employee scope and enable faster, more impactful ways of working." In practice this means a flatter, more flexible operating model. Firms that have harnessed AI in this way report having more satisfied, more optimistic employees.</div>

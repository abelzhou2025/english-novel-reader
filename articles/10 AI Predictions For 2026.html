        <div class="paragraph-block">
            <p class="english-text">AI research labs OpenAI and Anthropic are such unique organizations that it can be easy to forget that, ultimately, they are venture-backed businesses. And not just any venture-backed businesses---they are the fastest-growing and most capital-hungry venture-backed businesses in history.</p>

        <div class="paragraph-block">
            <p class="english-text">According to its own projections, Anthropic will burn through close to $20 billion before it becomes profitable, making it one of the most capital-intensive businesses in history. But that figure is dwarfed by OpenAI, which according to its own projections will need roughly $150 billion before it starts generating cash.</p>

        <div class="paragraph-block">

        <div class="paragraph-block">
            <p class="english-text">Companies with such staggering capital needs have no choice but to tap public capital markets in order to raise larger sums of both equity and debt financing.</p>

        <div class="paragraph-block">
            <p class="english-text">In 2025, Anthropic will grow from $1 billion to $9 billion in ARR (annual recurring revenue). OpenAI, meanwhile, will go from $6 billion to $20 billion ARR. Growth like this has never before been seen at this scale. Especially given the present AI exuberance, there will voracious demand for these companies in the public markets.</p>

        <div class="paragraph-block">
            <p class="english-text">Both companies have raised a lot of money from a lot of institutional investors over the past few years, many of them crossover investors whose primary focus is public markets. Pressure will begin to mount from this investor base to go public sooner rather than later in order to provide liquidity.</p>

        <div class="paragraph-block">
            <p class="english-text">We predict that, in 2026, Anthropic will debut on public markets. It will be one of the biggest and most highly anticipated IPOs of all-time.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="paragraph-block">
            <p class="english-text">Anthropic has reportedly already chosen a law firm, Wilson Sonsini, to work on its public offering and has begun spending time with investment bankers for the process. Hiring a heavy-hitting CFO is an important prerequisite to going public; last year Anthropic brought on Krishna Rao, who previously helped take Airbnb public, as its first CFO.</p>

            <p class="english-text">Just like Uber and Lyft in 2019, a race dynamic will emerge between these two competitors to get public first, which will further incentivize Anthropic to move quickly.</p>

        <div class="paragraph-block">
            <p class="english-text">For one thing, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has demonstrated a greater ability than any other CEO in history to raise capital from private markets. (OpenAI is currently seeking to raise a new private financing round of up to $100 billion.) This will enable OpenAI to put off the public markets for longer.</p>

        <div class="paragraph-block">

        <div class="paragraph-block">
            <p class="english-text">OpenAI is also a more complex and opaque business than Anthropic. While Anthropic has a more well-defined focus on the enterprise AI market, OpenAI is simultaneously pursuing opportunities in consumer AI, enterprise AI, consumer hardware, robotics, semiconductors, data centers, space, brain-computer interfaces, and more. Public markets mean increased scrutiny and transparency. Altman and OpenAI will have more incentive to delay the public markets for longer in order to avoid having to explain and justify their investments in all of these areas.</p>

        <div class="paragraph-block">

        <div class="paragraph-block">
            <p class="english-text">As a brief refresher, Ilya was OpenAI's cofounder and Chief Scientist until his dramatic falling-out with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman in late 2023. Ilya is widely regarded as one of the greatest---perhaps the single greatest---researcher in the field of modern AI. He has been the driving intellectual force behind many of the most fundamental breakthroughs in artificial intelligence over the past fifteen years, including the establishment of deep learning itself (with Geoff Hinton in 2012), the principle of scaling (at OpenAI in the late 2010s), and most recently the concept of reasoning models and test-time compute for LLMs (toward the end of his time at OpenAI).</p>

        <div class="paragraph-block">
            <p class="english-text">Ilya's unsuccessful attempt to oust Altman via a board coup was one of the most sensational events in the world of technology in recent memory. The board re-instated Altman as CEO within a few days and Ilya left the company shortly thereafter.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="paragraph-block">
            <p class="english-text">In his public statements since launching SSI, Ilya has been clear that he believes that the research direction that the large incumbent labs are pursuing---including his former company OpenAI---are destined to plateau and are not the best path to building superintelligence. He says he and SSI are working on something entirely new.</p>

            <p class="english-text">It is not easy to keep a secret in Silicon Valley. Information flows fast and freely. If one company has a great new idea, it is generally not long before its competitors are working on the same thing.

            <p class="english-text">Amusing anecdotes abound about the lengths to which SSI goes to preserve its secrecy, including prohibiting its employees from going out for meals in public together (lest their conversations be overheard) or from sharing anything about their work even with their spouses.</p>

            <p class="english-text">This secrecy cannot last forever. We predict that, in 2026, details of SSI's approach will finally leak to the public.

        <div class="paragraph-block">
            <p class="english-text">It was a bold and decisive move with clear logic. The U.S. and its western allies control the most advanced AI chips (e.g., Nvidia), the software needed to design those chips (e.g., Synopsys, Cadence), and the equipment needed to manufacture those chips (e.g., ASML). Control over this technology ecosystem represents a key chokepoint in the AI race.

They have therefore sought to strike more of a balance by permitting the sale of some advanced U.S. chips to compete with China's domestic providers. A few weeks ago, President Trump announced that he would approve the sale of Nvidia H200 GPUs to China.

So, for instance, if a company buys a piece of machinery for $10 million, and believes that the machine will productively function for 10 years, the company will depreciate its cost over that 10-year period, meaning that it recognizes $1 million in cost per year for ten years.</p>

It will be fascinating to watch this story play out in the headlines, and in CoreWeave's stock price, over the course of 2026.</p>

A few months ago, OpenAI announced a partnership with Broadcom to develop its own in-house chips. It is not crazy to imagine that, eventually, OpenAI will develop a new purpose-built chip for every new AI model generation that it trains, with the two co-optimized for one another.</p>

            <p class="english-text">OpenAI has enjoyed an aura of charmed invincibility since the 2022 debut of ChatGPT. It seemed the company could do no wrong. That has recently changed abruptly with the launch of Google's Gemini 3. The public narrative and vibe has rapidly shifted; it has become an increasingly consensus take that it is in fact Google and not OpenAI that is best positioned to win the AI race.</p>

        <div class="paragraph-block">
            <p class="english-text">OpenAI under Sam Altman is a company with sprawling ambitions. Beyond its core business of building and commercializing AI models, the company has partnered with Jony Ive to develop a next-generation consumer hardware device; it is developing its own semiconductors; it is building its own data centers; it is investing hundreds of millions of dollars into a brain-computer interface startup that Altman is cofounding; it is exploring acquiring a rocket (!) company.</p>

            <p class="english-text">With OpenAI coming back down to earth, though---with its models no longer state-of-the-art, with ChatGPT losing market share to Gemini---all these far-flung investments in disparate areas may suddenly start to look like, well, distractions. It may suddenly seem natural to ask the question: if OpenAI's core market (generative AI) is one of the biggest in the world, and that market is under serious threat from formidable competitors, ought not the company and its leadership be focusing entirely on that?</p>

        </div>
        <div class="paragraph-block">
            <p class="english-text">Compounding this dynamic is the fact that OpenAI will be under growing pressure to go public. As discussed above, OpenAI has raised a lot of money from a lot of investors over the past few years, many of them crossover investors whose primary focus is public markets. This investor base wants an IPO sooner rather than later in order to get liquidity. Anthropic is reportedly preparing for an IPO as soon as 2026, which will put added pressure on OpenAI to do the same. The simple reality is that OpenAI has such vast capital needs---more than any other company in history---that it eventually will have no choice but to IPO in order to tap public capital markets.</p>

        <div class="paragraph-block">
            <p class="english-text">Public companies are heavily scrutinized and regulated. They must be operated in a fundamentally different---and more disciplined---way than private companies. The analogy is far from perfect, but when Uber was preparing itself to be a public company, it swapped out its visionary and distractable founding CEO (Travis Kalanick) for a professional CEO with public company experience (Dara Khosrowshahi). Might OpenAI be approaching its "Dara era"?</p>

            <p class="english-text">Add to this another consideration: it is not totally clear that Altman wants to be in charge of running OpenAI on a day-to-day basis, with all of the mundane minutiae that entails. Earlier this year, Altman announced that OpenAI was hiring Instacart CEO Fidji Simo as its "CEO of Applications." In explaining the hire, Altman wrote that Simo would "focus on enabling our 'traditional' company functions to scale as we enter a new phase of growth," while Altman himself would "increase my focus on Research, Compute and Safety Systems." How many companies can you think of that have multiple people with a "CEO" title?</p>

        <div class="paragraph-block">
            <p class="english-text">In 2026, we predict that OpenAI's board and leadership, including Altman himself, will come to the conclusion that Altman is no longer the best person to lead the organization as it prepares for life as a public company. Will OpenAI's board fire Altman? Will Altman choose to step down and move on to his next chapter? The reality is that the public won't know, and it won't really matter. Unlike the dramatic events of November 2023, in which OpenAI's board shocked the world by abruptly firing Altman, this transition will be tightly choreographed. It will be portrayed as Altman's decision. He will announce the news on his terms.</p>

        <div class="paragraph-block">
            <p class="english-text">A logical way to analyze the politics of AI would be as follows: Republicans are generally champions of private industry and favor less government regulation. They should therefore celebrate the rapid advancement of the AI industry and support a hands-off regulatory approach. Republicans are also particularly focused on national security, and as AI becomes a key factor in the global competition with China, this is all the more reason for them to support AI's rapid and unfettered development domestically. Democrats, on the other hand, are more concerned with potential negative societal impacts of commercial and technological activity and more focused on promoting the fair distribution of economic gains. They should therefore be more ambivalent toward the advance of AI and more willing to pass laws to regulate and moderate its progress.</p>

            <p class="english-text">To this point, President Trump and his administration have largely adhered to the logic laid out above. The Trump administration has been a proactive champion of AI development and has staunchly opposed any sort of AI regulation. A number of prominent Silicon Valley figures with technolibertarian leanings, including many from the Peter Thiel and Marc Andreessen orbits, are in positions of power in Trump's administration and are actively promoting a tech-friendly agenda.</p>

Graduating college students are suddenly finding it difficult to get jobs because entry-level roles can increasingly be carried out by AI. Companies across sectors laid off tens of thousands of workers this year as a direct result of AI. And this is just the tip of the iceberg. According to an MIT study released last month, AI can now replace 11.7% of the U.S. workforce, representing over $1 trillion in wages.</p>

And President Trump, though he was elected as a member of the Republican Party, has a serious populist streak in him. Trump will increasingly find himself compelled to side with, and to speak out in favor of protecting the jobs of, everyday working Americans against the encroachment of AI.

Typically, this has taken the form of commercial deals whereby the startups use their AI to generate some candidates for the pharma company and in return receive a mix of upfront payments, milestone-based payments and future royalties. To this point, pharma companies have generally not acquired AI companies outright, preferring to only do big acquisitions when a startup has a specific therapeutic asset that the pharma company believes is worth paying for.</p>

            <p class="english-text">Because AI's promise is no longer merely hypothetical in this field---it is now really starting to work---and things will therefore start moving much more quickly. It will now become more compelling and even necessary for pharma companies to bring these AI platforms in-house, integrate them more tightly with their broader development and clinical pipelines, enable a faster flywheel of research and development, and preclude these startups from working with other pharma competitors.</p>

            <p class="english-text">As is the case in frontier AI more broadly, world-class talent in AI for protein design is incredibly rare. Only a handful of people on earth are capable of developing cutting-edge AI systems for de novo antibody design. And those people generally don't choose to work at big pharma companies like Merck or Pfizer. Many of them are concentrated in a small group of leading protein AI startups. M\&A will present a path for the big pharma players to bring this key talent in-house.</p>

        <div class="paragraph-block">
            <p class="english-text">To most people, brain-computer interfaces (BCI) sound like science fiction. People may be loosely familiar with Elon Musk's Neuralink, but generally assume that the technology is many years or even decades away from the real world.</p>

        <div class="paragraph-block">
            <p class="english-text">In fact, this technology is rapidly nearing an inflection point in terms of real-world functionality. 2026 will be the year that that becomes broadly understood and that interest in BCI goes mainstream. Expect to see a wave of new BCI startups, a surge in venture capital dollars invested in BCI, meaningful clinical progress (though no FDA approvals yet), and a step-change increase in public discourse about the technology.</p>

        <div class="paragraph-block">
            <p class="english-text">The field of BCI consists of two main camps: invasive technologies (which require surgery) and non-invasive technologies (which do not). Both will experience dramatic progress next year.</p>

        <div class="paragraph-block">
            <p class="english-text">On the non-invasive side, ultrasound-based techniques will emerge as the buzziest and most promising BCI approach. Startups like Nudge (which recently announced a $100 million Series A led by Thrive and Greenoaks) and Merge Labs (Sam Altman's new BCI startup, into which OpenAI is reportedly investing hundreds of millions of dollars) will rank among 2026's trendiest companies and will raise big new rounds. Other non-invasive approaches, including silent speech and EEG, will also enjoy plenty of momentum.</p>

        <div class="paragraph-block">
            <p class="english-text">On the invasive side, Neuralink has long been the dominant player. The company is effectively synonymous with the entire field of BCI today. It has a world-class team and has played a central role for years in moving this field forward. Next year, however, as BCI enters the spotlight, Neuralink's position as the category leader will become shakier.</p>

        <div class="paragraph-block">
            <p class="english-text">Neuralink was founded in 2016. The company set its technology and product direction based on the state of the art at that time, and has been executing against it since then. But BCI science has advanced tremendously over the past few years.</p>

        <div class="paragraph-block">
            <p class="english-text">As one example, Neuralink's technology is based on penetrating electrodes: electronics that physically penetrate into a patient's brain. Sticking a foreign object into brain tissue kills neurons and causes some brain damage, but enables the BCI to collect high-fidelity data from the brain. This tradeoff is captured by a concept in BCI technology known (vividly) as the "butcher ratio": the ratio of the number of neurons that a BCI technology kills relative to the number of neurons that it can record from.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="paragraph-block">
            <p class="english-text">Over the past few years, newer invasive techniques have been developed that enable equivalent or even superior performance to penetrating electrodes without needing to be physically jammed into the brain. (In other words, these newer techniques have a butcher ratio of zero.)</p>

        <div class="paragraph-block">
            <p class="english-text">In fact, two different Neuralink cofounders left the company to launch new BCI companies---Ben Rapaport with Precision Neuroscience and Max Hodak with Science Corporation---because they concluded that penetrating electrodes and a high butcher ratio were not the right path forward for the field.</p>

        <div class="paragraph-block">
            <p class="english-text">"For a medical device, safety often implies minimal invasiveness," Rapaport said in an interview last year. "In the early days of brain-computer interfaces, there was this notion that in order to extract information-rich data from the brain, one needed to penetrate the brain with tiny little needle-like electrodes. But this method has one big drawback: it causes some amount of brain damage when they're inserted to the brain. We realized it was possible to extract information-rich data from the brain without damaging the brain."</p>

        <div class="paragraph-block">
            <p class="english-text">Precision Neuroscience uses a technology known as electrocorticography (ECoG), which entails putting sensors underneath the skull, directly on the surface of the brain, but not penetrating into it. Recent research has shown that surface ECoG can enable more sophisticated BCI capabilities than what has been achieved with penetrating electrodes. Science Corporation is pursuing an even more futuristic technology: a biohybrid neural interface in which biological neurons are grown in a lab, then embedded into an electronic BCI, then implanted into a patient's brain, such that the engineered neurons gradually grow into and form connections with the patient's own neurons.</p>

First, instead of relying on simple keywords, consumers can now describe their needs in greater detail and with higher precision, leading to more targeted and relevant results. Second, if a consumer has interacted with, say, ChatGPT over time, the system learns a great deal about the user---often more comprehensively than Google---which further refines the search outcomes. Third, AI-assisted search typically provides detailed summaries of each option and can even generate comparison tables. As a result, consumers may no longer need to click through individual links to check details themselves---a key difference from traditional search that further reduces search costs.</div>

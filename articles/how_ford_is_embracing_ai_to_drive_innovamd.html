Driving Strategy and Vision: As CDAIO for Ford, Bell is responsible for defining and aligning the company around its enterprise-wide Data and AI strategies to ensure that Ford is making the right investments to maintain a competitive edge.
Enabling the Business: Bell's organization provides the foundational platforms, such as the Enterprise Data Platform (EDP), and democratized tools that empower teams across Ford to build and deploy AI solutions securely and efficiently. Bell notes that Ford had the foresight to centralize its data team 10 years ago. This provides the advantage, explains Bell, to "connect the dots across the company, and sets us up nicely to re-use technology, making us faster and more efficient."
Governance and Oversight: Bell chairs Ford's Enterprise Data Council, which governs the company's data assets, platform usage, and technology investments. This ensures that Ford is using its resources effectively, avoiding duplicative efforts, and building on a common, scalable foundation. It also ensures that Ford is protecting personal information and ensuring Ford has the appropriate approaches to protecting consumer privacy.</div>

Virtual Wind Tunnel: Ford has developed proprietary AI models that reduce the time for a complex aerodynamic simulation from 15 hours to approximately 10 seconds (a 5000x speed increase), with results that are within 2.3% of the traditional physics-based models. This allows Ford engineers to iterate and optimize designs at a speed that was previously unimaginable.
AI-Powered Customer Support : Ford has launched an AI agent on the Ford.com site that acts as a single front door for customer questions. It can query multiple knowledge bases, access tools like a towing calculator, and synthesize the information into one clear, referenced answer, dramatically improving the customer experience.
AI-Supercharged Code Reviews: In software engineering, Ford has implemented an AI-assisted "code reviews-as-a-service" capability. Early results with over 1,000 software engineers have shown a 3x reduction in cycle time, allowing Ford to innovate on digital experiences much faster.</div>

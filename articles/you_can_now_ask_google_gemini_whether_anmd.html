 First, I uploaded a real photo to Gemini. It correctly declared the image "was not created with Google AI."  Then, I uploaded an AI image made by ChatGPT. OpenAI does not use the SynthID system, which Gemini recognized. However, it did pick up on "several tell-tale signs" typical of AI-generated imagery. It highlighted the distorted Starbucks logos on the cups and the "blocky" look of the cartoon. It even went on to specifically name ChatGPT as the potential source.  Finally, I uploaded a photo edited on Google's AI studio. It picked up the SynthID and declared it to be "all or part" created with Google AI. It also comically picked up on "unrealistic animal behavior."</div>
